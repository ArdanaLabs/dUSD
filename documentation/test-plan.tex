\section{Introduction}

\textbf{The purpose of this document is to let the dUSD team decide whether we are ready to deploy.}
It is a living document that serves as a forcing function for discussions around, and agreement on, decisions.

The document starts with the "Interactions" section, a user-centric perspective on what service we would like to offer.
Next come descriptions of requirements we have on those interactions in the "Acceptance criteria" section.
Any important implementation details that will be relevant for building such a system are detailed in the section after that.
Finally, the "Tests" section provide a non-exhaustive list of the way we plan to falsify whether we should deploy.
