\section{Interactions}

\subsection{Browser App}

The browser app supports the following interactions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Viewing current datum
  \item Viewing transaction status 
  \item Locking funds
  \item Incrementing datum
  \item Redeeming funds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Command-line App}

The command-line app supports the following interactions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Viewing supported commands
  \item Viewing UTxO state 
  \item Locking funds
  \item Incrementing datum
  \item Redeeming funds
\end{itemize}


\section{Acceptance Criteria}

\subsection{Command-line App}

As a command-line user with a key wallet containing ADA, the following should be true:

\subsubsection{Send Datum}
Given increment interval i and initial value n, I want to publish a UTxO where the following
is true:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The UTxO belongs to the validator script address.
  \item The UTxO contains n as the datum hash.
  \item The UTxO locks an arbitrary amount of ADA.
  \item The UTxO can be used as an input in a transaction that creates a new UTxO at the script
        address with a datum containing the value n + i.
  \item The locked funds in the UTxO can be redeemed by any user.      
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Increment Datum}
Given increment interval i, initial value n, and an existing UTxO at the validator script address, 
I want to publish a UTxO where the following is true:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The new UTxO belongs to the validator script address.
  \item The new UTxO contains the amount of ADA contained in the existing UTxO.
  \item The new UTxO contains n + i as the datum hash.    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Redeem Funds}
Given a UTxO at a validator address, I want to publish a UTxO where the following is true:
\begin{itemize}
  \item I can unlock the funds in the validator UTxO.
  \item The new UTxO belongs to my script address.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Browser App}

As a browser user with a Nami wallet containing ADA, the following should be true:

\subsubsection{Initialization}

I would like to be able to click a button where once clicked the following is true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The click will trigger Nami to prompt for a signature.
  \item The button will show loading dialogue.
  \item The button will be disabled
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{State Management}

Once the initialization is complete, I would like to be able to click two buttons,
One to increment the value in the UTxO and one to redeem the funds locked in the
validator script UTxO.

I would like to be able to view the state of the increment value where the following
is true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There should be an integer that represents the current increment value of the
        UTxO.
\end{itemize}

For the increment button, when clicked, the following should be true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The click will trigger Nami to prompt for a signature.
  \item The button will show loading dialogue.
  \item The button will be disabled.
\end{itemize}

When the increment transaction is complete, the following should be true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The button should be reenabled.
  \item The loading dialogue should be removed.
  \item The integer that represents the current increment value of the
        UTxO should be incremented
\end{itemize}

For the redeem button, when clicked, the following should be true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The click will trigger Nami to prompt for a signature.
  \item The button will show loading dialogue.
  \item The button will be disabled.
\end{itemize}

When the redeem transaction is complete, the following should be true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The increment button will be removed.
  \item The redeem button will be removed.
  \item The increment value will be removed.
  \item The initialize button will return.
\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation Details}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This all happens in the dUSD repo
  \item On-chain code written in Plutarch
  \item Off-chain code written in Purescript
  \item Plutarch code gets compiled into a ByteString, which can be included in
    the CTL transactions
  \item Front-end
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Foundations built in HTML/CSS, driven by a Purescript app
    \item User wallet: Nami (for first version).
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
